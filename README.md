# Supplements-Price-Alert
This project contains a Python web scraping script that collects and stores data from Bulk.com on two popular gym supplements: protein and creatine. The datasets are updated weekly, and a Telegram bot sends alerts if new data contain price anomalies or values below a set threshold.
